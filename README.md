# Velox
## A very stupid and unoptimised game engine(Do not use this unless you know what you are doing).

# How to build
To build Velox(only supported on windows for now), just execute the Build.bat script and and run the solution in Visual Studio.
I know, this is very inconvenient but I will make a proper system later on(I'm way too lazy right now :v).
